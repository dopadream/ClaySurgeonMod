# Clay Surgeon Overhaul

This mod completely replaces the Barber's model with an overhauled model I made from scratch in blender and applied a clay shader to. It should hopefully meet the standards of Lethal Company's roster (subjectively) better. \
The animations have also been completely remade. There are also custom proximity ambience sounds that I made in FL Studio.

This mod also depends on BarberFixes/VentSpawnFix as I have also tweaked the spawning mechanics of the Barber to both add it to the list of infestations that can happen as well.
Everything is configurable. 

By default, the Clay Surgeon's acceleration will increase at a curve, increasing more during the start of the day and less near the end. This is also configurable.

Clay Surgeons spawn in pairs (again, by default), if you see one, keep your eyes peeled! If you're having trouble, turn on ``drumrollFromAll`` in BarberFixes' config!

There's also a custom bestiary entry, be sure to check that out!
