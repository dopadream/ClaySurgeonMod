# Clay Surgeon Overhaul

This mod completely replaces the Barber's model with an overhauled model I made from scratch in blender and applied a clay shader to.

This mod also depends on BarberFixes/VentSpawnFix as I have also tweaked the spawning mechanics of the Barber to both add it to the list of infestations that can happen as well.
Everything is configurable.

There's also a custom bestiary entry, be sure to check that out!
