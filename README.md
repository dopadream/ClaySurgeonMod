# Clay Surgeon Overhaul

This mod completely replaces the Barber's model with a new design I made from scratch in blender that I applied a clay shader to. It should hopefully meet the standards of Lethal Company's roster (subjectively) better. \
The animations have also been completely remade, and it adds a new proximity based ambient sound with a volume slider.

The Clay Surgeon's movement acceleration will increase at a curve, increasing more during the start of the day and less near the end. Clay Surgeons also spawn in pairs, if you see one, keep your eyes peeled! If you're having trouble, turn on ``drumrollFromAll`` in BarberFixes' config! All of this is configurable! 

There's also a custom bestiary entry, be sure to check that out!

This mod depends on BarberFixes/VentSpawnFix to apply the spawn settings without breaking.

BarberMaterialTweaks is incompatible and will not load with this mod installed.
